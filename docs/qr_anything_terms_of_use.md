# Terms of Use

Last updated: November 27, 2025

Welcome to QR Anything. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the QR Anything mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use the App.

## 1. Use of the App

The App is provided to help you generate, scan, and manage QR codes. You may use the App for personal and non-commercial purposes only, unless you obtain our prior written permission.

You agree not to use the App to:
- Violate any applicable law or regulation;
- Infringe the intellectual property or other rights of third parties;
- Transmit viruses, malware, or other harmful code; or
- Collect personal data from other users without their consent.

## 2. Accountability and Content

You are solely responsible for any content you create, upload, generate, or share using the App. We do not claim ownership of your content, but by using the App you grant the App a limited license to store and process such content as necessary to provide the service.

## 3. Privacy and Data Storage

The App stores QR history and app settings locally on your device using Hive (a local storage solution). We do not transmit or store your QR content on our servers by default. For full details about what data may be stored and how it's handled, please read our Privacy Policy (linked from the app's Settings).

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App may integrate with third-party libraries and services (for example, QR scanning, sharing and analytics). Use of those services is governed by the third party's terms and privacy policies.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranty, express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will the App authors, contributors, or distributors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the App.

## 7. Modifications to Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify users through the App or by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.

## 8. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the App owner operates, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
