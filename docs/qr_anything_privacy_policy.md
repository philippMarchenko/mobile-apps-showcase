# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how QR Anything (the "App") collects, uses, stores, and discloses information when you use the App.

## 1. Data Controller

If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy, please contact: neuraapps1991@gmail.com

## 2. Information We Collect

- Local data: The App stores QR history and application settings locally on your device using Hive. This data includes QR content (text scanned or generated), timestamps, and a type label (generated or scanned).
- Device metadata: The App may access device-level features such as the camera to scan QR codes. Camera access is requested at runtime and is used only for scanning functionality.
- No remote collection by default: The App does not send your QR content or stored history to any remote servers by default.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information to provide and maintain the App's core functionality (scanning, generating, saving history), to improve the App, and to respond to support requests.

## 4. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share or sell your QR content or history to third parties. The App may use third-party libraries (for example, share functionality) that invoke system share sheets or 3rd-party apps; sharing to those services is initiated by the user and not performed by the App on our behalf.

## 5. Storage and Security

Your QR history and settings are stored locally using Hive. We recommend that you back up your device and use device-level security (PIN/biometrics) if you want additional protection. While we take reasonable steps to secure local storage, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Permissions

The App requests camera access to scan QR codes. Permission is requested at runtime and the App handles the potential denial of permission gracefully.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe we have collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at the address above.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy within the App and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
